        <p class="project-tile">enter project here... How does one do that? Is that what a JSON file is used for? idek what a JSON is, honestly. All I know is it's a file type used in coding... I think it works with Python? But if I need it here, that would mean it works with HTML/CSS as well. Maybe it's a file that holds code, like I've been using TXT files to store copies of all my freeCodeCamp assignments offline for my own reference? Now that I think about it, I'm not sure coding makes use of TXT files except for "ReadMe"s. Maybe there's a limited functionality? If TXT files can only be treated as a string... can JSON files be treated as a different type? Oh! Can they be treated as an array, list or dictionary? That would make sense... I think. There was something I hit when working on my FFXIV Crafting Project that said something like using a JSON to interact with a database... Anyway! Back to work! I'm not gonna learn how to finish that project by typing a diary entry in an HTML/CSS class. Uhh... nevermind. I'm supposed to link to a project. So, no JSON... but what link is it talking about?? ... I get the feeling I don't know half the functionality of freeCodeCamp. Sometimes it hints that it's another social media site, other times that it's a version of the online "Blackboard" a college would use. Meanwhile I'm just using it like a solo video game. Learn the mechanics of the boss fight to finish the level, ya know? ... I got distracted again.</p>
